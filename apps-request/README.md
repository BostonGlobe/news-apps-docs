# Apps Request

*The following is a working draft of our process for developing Globe interactives from start to finish. It is based on the Chicago Tribune News Apps agile development process.*

## Request
We get pitched or asked to work on a project (story, tool, etc).

**We want:** A brief pitch about the project (think elevator pitch). It should be high level, non-technical, and identify the primary userâ€™s needs.

Example: Faces of the Field:
*We want users to be able to look at the demographic data of the field of runners through anecdotes of types of runners.  Highlight both the stories and the statistics to put a face to the data.*

**Other things we want:**
- Who is the target audience(s) and what is their desire?
- Who are all the stakeholders involved? (reporters, devs, designers, editors, producers...)
- What is the deadline?
- Are there any pre-existing assets? (images, video, data...)

## Evaluate 
We review project along with deadline and current workload to decide if it is feasible and worth pursuing. Also, are we the best team to handle the job?

## Determine features
Create a list of needs and wants for the end users in collaboration with the stakeholders (if an internal tool, this could be producers and devs, or it might be a specific demographic of our readers). From this list, create possible features that would satisfy all needs and wants. Prioritize all features and agree upon order of importance.

## Create manifesto
This is a brief statement of the core purpose and goal of the project (tagline). When new issues and decisions come about they should be made with this in mind.

## Code & review, repeat
- Scaffold project
- Create milestones and deliverable deadlines
- Create workflow for content management if needed
- Populate list of issues/dev tasks
- Schedule review times with stakeholders to track progress, resolve issues, and just make sure it is headed in the right direction
