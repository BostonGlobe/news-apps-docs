# Unfold: setup new story

Follow the steps below to setup a new developing story

## Create Doc
* Log in to the **bostonglobegraphics** gmail account
* In the `unfold` folder, make a copy of `unfold - TEMPLATE`
* Rename it to `unfold - some name`

## Share Doc
* Right click on the new doc and select **Get shareable link**


## Add Story to master list
* Open the *unfold - MASTER LIST* doc
* Create the following lines below, under **[stories]** 

Example:
```
id: put-google-doc-id-here
year: 2016
month: 07
name: something-happened
```

## Notes when filling out the object:
* **id**: Grab the big chunk of random numbers and letters after the **document/d/** in the story Google Doc
* **year**: 4-digit year
* **month**: 2-digit with leading 0
* **name**: short, just letters and dashes instead of spaces

## Preview
Once the new contents are in the *unfold - MASTER LIST*, a new page will be created and updated every minute. If done correctly, the new story will show up on [the unfold internal page](http://unfold.bostonglobe.com).

## Disable
To stop updates and the ability to publish changes, simply remove the object from the *unfold - MASTER LIST*.
